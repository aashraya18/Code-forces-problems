***COMMENTS (question)***
We call two numbers x and y similar if they have the same parity (the same remainder when divided by 2), or if |xâˆ’y|=1. For example, in each of the pairs (2,6), (4,3), (11,7), the numbers are similar to each other, and in the pairs (1,4), (3,12), they are not.

You are given an array a of n (n is even) positive integers. Check if there is such a partition of the array into pairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the numbers in each pair are similar to each other.

For example, for the array a=[11,14,16,12], there is a partition into pairs (11,12) and (14,16). The numbers in the first pair are similar because they differ by one, and in the second pair because they are both even.
